<p>Epigenetics is a conceptually and practically challenging area of research. However, work over the past 5 years has suggested it could be behind many of the remaining questions we have about how cancers arise, proliferate, and reappear.</p>

<p>Nearly 2 decades since the human genome was sequenced for the first time, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2003Trusted Source</a>, there are still many questions that remain about how our genomes work.</p>

<p>While sequencing the human genome has provided an enormous amount of insight into the ways our cells and bodies work, a clear understanding of the genetic mechanisms underpinning many common diseases and our health has remained elusive.</p>

<p><strong>One reason for this is that while our DNA encodes the information that allows us to develop, grow and repair our cells and tissues, the expression of our genes is controlled by other mechanisms. For our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/120574">genes</a>&nbsp;to be expressed, they first need to be read, or transcribed, and then the molecules they code for made, or translated.</strong></p>
